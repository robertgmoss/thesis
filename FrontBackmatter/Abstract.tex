\chapter*{Abstract}
%The basic need to search for data has always occupied many great researchers.  This has become ever more pressing with the growth of data that can no longer be stored and retrieved efficiently using traditional database technologies.  A new paradigm has emerged away from the relational model that models these data as points in a space.
%
%In this thesis we investigate the properties of a distance metric devised for semi-structured data such as XML that is based on Information Theory, we then apply it to important tasks, such as information retrieval, or knowledge discovery in databases and compare it to existing techniques.
