\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I wish to thank everyone who has supported me throughout my doctoral studies and listened to my endless droning.  In particular, I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Richard Connor, your support, comments and wisdom have been invaluable throughout.  Secondly, I would like to thank Morgan Harvey, my friend and colleague for his interesting and useful insights that have kept me going when inspiration was low.  

Thanks go to those who read and provided comments on this thesis...
